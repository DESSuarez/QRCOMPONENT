## My process
I began this challenge by reading the 'readm.me' archive after downloading my zip file. Once I understood the task and reviewed the provided resources and tools, including the style guide, I created a new index.html file, CSS style sheet, and normalize sheet to initiate the design process. Throughout the challenge, I kept both the desktop and mobile design JPGs open on my monitor, allowing me to compare the original design with my own development.

Subsequently, I delved into writing my HTML code while ensuring careful attention was given to structuring the required content effectively. This aspect wasn't particularly difficult since the challenge was concise. Afterwards, I proceeded to open my CSS file and define the global properties in the style sheet. I linked both my CSS style sheet and Normalize sheet to my HTML file, following the same process for the Google Fonts API. Next, I began defining the colors to be applied and proceeded to style the text and title (H1) according to the specifications outlined in the style guide.

Continuously, I made adjustments to the box-sizing, text height, and margins within the header and footer sections to closely resemble the original design. To ensure responsiveness, I incorporated media queries and utilized various CSS custom properties to give the margins a rounded appearance. Finally, I visually compared both designs and tested my development using the Responsively App.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS Media Queries
- Google Fonts APIs


### What I learned

I learned to attend to the requested design by visually iterating and adjusting parameters. Utilizing CSS grid, I successfully centered the elements in my container, which proved to be an excellent solution for the task. Throughout the process, I gained insights into the time required to sketch a design from scratch independently. I take pride in what I have achieved here and eagerly look forward to completing future challenges.


### Continued development

Moving forward, my focus will be on efficient decision-making, allowing me to continue development without fixating on achieving pixel-perfection. I'm curious to explore solutions using flexbox or automatically adjusting images to the container without manually altering height and width values in HTML. Additionally, I aim to write cleaner code that is understandable to everyone while maintaining a lean size for optimal performance on web servers.


### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow) - This helped me with the box shadow effect in the design. I really reccomend this source, it's easy to use and has great coverage.
- [Resource 2](https://responsively.app/download/) - This is an amazing app that helps with building a responsive design. You can emulate your frontend design as in an Iphone, IPad, Mac and in many other screen devices.
